About project.

The Fake News Predictor is a machine learning project developed to identify and classify fake news articles using a logistic regression model. By leveraging the author's name and the headline of a news article, this project provides a robust solution for detecting misinformation and misleading content.

Using a carefully curated dataset, this project trains a logistic regression model to analyze key features such as the author's credibility and the language used in the headline. The model learns from patterns in these features to predict the likelihood of an article being fake or genuine.

Key Features:

Author-Based Analysis: The project takes into account the author's reputation and historical credibility to assess the reliability of the news article.

Headline Analysis: The model extracts essential information from the headline to capture language patterns and indicators of potential misinformation.

Logistic Regression Model: Leveraging the logistic regression algorithm, the project effectively maps the input features to a binary classification output, indicating whether the news is likely to be fake or genuine.
